âœ¨ A powerful yet straightforward personality quiz creation and sharing platform. With an intuitive quiz design editor and platform, anyone can create their very own dynamic quiz with automatic result calculations and respondent categorization. Then, share your "vibe check" with friends, sit back, and watch as the results come rolling in!

I began making this project when I started tier-listing things and wanted a more "calculated" way of doing so, so I could feel like they were a little more "accurate" (I love science and value precision). I used NextJS, Tailwind, Shadcn ui, oRPC, Drizzle ORM, and Neobrutalism.dev for this project to try something new. I'd never used most of these before so it was a bit of a struggle to get used to them and get over the learning curve, but it was a really great learning opportunity!

## Features

- Register an account and log in (w/ email & password)
- Create a quiz
- View, edit, and delete a quiz with a visual builder
- Take a quiz and receive personalized and ranked results

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now your very own vibecheck development instance is running on localhost!

# TODOs:

- Integrated result-sharing mechanism
- Different "types" of questions
- UUID ids instead of serial ids
- Better quiz input validation
- Enhanced profile page with quiz result-based badges?
- Tier lists?
